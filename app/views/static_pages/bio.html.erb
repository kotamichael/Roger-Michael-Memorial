<h1>Roger Mark Michael</h1>

<p>ROGER MARK MICHAEL, 64, departed this life for the next on January 5, 2019.  Born on July 1, 1955, in Clarksburg WV to Ernest and Martha Michael, and he was a graduate of South Harrison High School.  Roger resided in Fort Wayne IN with his wife of 25 years.</p>

<p>Roger is survived by his wife Dacia, his three sons, Jeremy Michael (Amber), Dakota Michael and Dawson Michael (Jessica), and his three grandchildren Joshua, Lauri Ann and Rylie Marcella.  He is also survived by two sisters, and two brothers, Frankie Kelley (Layton), Connie Reynolds (Ken), Jeff Michael, Tim Michael (Raelynn), as well as twelve nieces and nephews.  Roger was preceded by both his parents, and his brother Lynn Michael.</p>

<p>There was nothing more important to Roger than family. There was nothing Roger would not do for family.  And, there was nothing Roger lived for more than family.  He was flawed and broken, and yet strong, resilient, and a fierce defender of family, friends and the less fortunate.  While there were those who feared him, Roger was truly a gentle soul whose fierceness arose from his incredible drive to fight and stand for the justice of others.</p>

<p>When it came to responsibility, Roger never shied away no matter the cost to self.  He was a tireless worker, and laser focused once a project began.  Roger was a simple man who desired little other than family and traveling with his family as often as possible.  He adored his children and grandchildren.  Little Lauri Ann called him Papaw and bossed him around as they worked on cars, watered the plants, took long walks, painted rocks and found ways to play in water both indoors and out.</p>

<p>Roger considered eating an inconvenient necessity but he did like steak and potatoes, pepperoni pizza, cookies, donuts, apple pie, coffee at all hours of the day, regular Coke and the other food group BREAD!  He was quiet but quick witted, he managed to win way too many of the games we played, and he loved nothing more than a good slapstick prank and joking around.  Firecrackers and cold water were often involved.</p>

<p>Roger loved his home state West Virginia for its mountains and call to a simpler life, but left it all behind to be with his immediate family in the flatlands of Indiana.  If he could have convinced us, he would have sold the house to travel across the United States in an RV.  There were so many places he still longed to see and so many family visits to attend.</p>

<p>Roger came into this world with so little.  He rose above and let go of so many challenges in life without letting it cause him to be bitter and hard although many saw him as hard.  He expected so little in regards to materials things, and yet hated that he did not have more to leave to his family.  Roger did not always fully understand that he was fearfully and wonderfully made in the image of God just as God had planned.  The legacy he left far outweighs any significance of tangible or material things.  Roger was divinely and uniquely what we needed, cherished and will deeply miss despite our rejoicing that he is now made perfect and no longer suffers.  Although Roger was born in 1955, he often seemed to be from a far earlier era of extreme modesties and occasional political incorrectness.  The stories will be passed on for many decades.</p>
